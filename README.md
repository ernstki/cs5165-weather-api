CS5165 Homework #2 - Weather REST API

You will also need to add a `REST.md` “markdown” document to your GitHub, and document the resources in your API, the input parameters + data-types they accept, and the parameters & data-types that will be in the results.

## Requirements
Your assignment will be graded on the following metrics:

* Does the output conform exactly to the specifications?  
* Is the REST.md well-formatted markdown and complete?  
* Are the HTTP codes correct ? Example - 200 for OK. 201 for created. 404 for not found and so on.  
* Does the REST API accept the inputs as GET or POST parameters?  
* Is the result well-formed (does it adhere to JSON or XML standards) and returned as an HTTP 200 “Ok” result?  
* Does the REST API yield results consistent with the same data?
